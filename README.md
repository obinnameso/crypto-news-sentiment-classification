## Project Description
<br>
In this project, we developed a sentiment analysis tool for climate-related tweets, enabling companies to gauge public perception of climate change by their tweets. By analyzing Twitter discussions, businesses can gain insights into how their products or services might be perceived in the context of climate sentiment.

We investigated various supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, to identify the most effective classifier for predicting climate sentiment in tweets. We employed GridSearchCV to optimize the parameters of our chosen model.
